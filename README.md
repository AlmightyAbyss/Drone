# Control Drones Using Hand Gestures

The files in this repo are to explain the idea we proposed in PyCon APAC 2022.

While working on our idea, we found another similar and more complete version of [Drone control via gestures using MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/09/drone-control-via-gestures-using-mediapipe-hands.html).  Ours could be viewed as a simpler and more intuitive version of the same thing.  And, the major difference would be the way we train our model.  They used tensorflow + deep learning to train their model, and we use Scikit-Learn for it.
